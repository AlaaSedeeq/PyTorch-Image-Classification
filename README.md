# PyTorch Image Classification
An easy step-by-step guide to building a classifier to classify the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST handwritten digit dataset</a>.

## This Notebook includes an implementation for:
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Net

## MNIST:
- The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
- The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.
- Although the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from scratch.
